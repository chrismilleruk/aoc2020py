# Advent of Code 2020 - Python edition

I've decided to do this year's Advent of Code in a language I'm not all that familiar with. 
I was deciding between Python, Lua, Swift, Kotlin & Go. In the end I chose Python, I may take another run with a strongly typed language later.

This project structure is based on an awesome repl.it template which got me up and running in minutes!!

I found that I really couldn't survive without a test framework by about Day 5/6 which means the odd codewars kata I've been doing here and there has been sinking in.

After a few false starts, I managed to integrate pytest to the existing runner.py and the workflow is now pretty nice & consistent.

The more I learn about python, the more I like it :-)
